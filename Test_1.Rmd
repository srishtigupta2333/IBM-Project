```

##  Intorduction

This report explores the motor trend using `mtcars` focuses on *number of cylinders* , *mileage*
 For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

kable(head(mtcars), caption = "First few rows of mtcars data set")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
